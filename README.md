## NB
[1] This scraper has been done for offline reading only, please consider visiting https://yatuu.fr and [supporting](https://fr.tipeee.com/yatuu) the author if you like her work.

[2] Eventhough the regex is ugly it is still not perfect, some images are fetched but shouldn't. I don't think any is missing, but just in case ALL images' URLs that are found in crawled pages are saved into a file, so that you can download them later if needed.
